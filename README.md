Design: In an observational cohort of pregnant women with pregestational type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy before the last menstrual period (LMP), we emulated a target trial with two treatment strategies: 1) insulin monotherapy: discontinue metformin and initiate insulin within 90 days after LMP, or 2) insulin plus metformin: continue metformin and initiate insulin within 90 days after LMP. 

Setting: US Medicaid health care administration database (2000-2018).
